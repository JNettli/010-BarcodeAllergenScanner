# Barcode Allergen Scanner

Welcome to the Barcode Allergen Scanner project! 
Our team of five has developed a mobile application that allows users to scan product barcodes to retrieve allergy information. 
This README will guide you through the project's overview, features, and how to get started with the application.

## Project Overview

The Barcode Allergen Scanner aims to address the need for quick and convenient access to allergy information while shopping for food products. 
By scanning product barcodes or manually inputting codes, users can retrieve detailed allergy information and manage their own allergies within the app.

## Design
